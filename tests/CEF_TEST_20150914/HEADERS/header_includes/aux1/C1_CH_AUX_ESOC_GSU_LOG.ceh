The GSU-LOG is maintained by the Spacecraft controllers. It includes all extra passes, not shown in the planning (so-called OMS11) and catches all deviations from planned AOS/LOS times. This information could be helpful to reconstruct from which ground station the data were received in case of a problem with the time correlation."
